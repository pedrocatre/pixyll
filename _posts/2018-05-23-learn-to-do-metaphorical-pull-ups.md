I went from doing zero pull ups to doing pull ups with 16Kg tied around my waist in very little time. It was simple using progressive overload.

> Progressive overload is the gradual increase of stress placed upon the body during exercise training.

How you can go about applying this:

* Start by watching a youtube video teaching you how to do a pull up.
* Since you can't do a single pull up at that point you do an assisted pull up (I used an assisted pull up machine for this).
* Once you can do 6 pull ups remove some of the assistance.
* Once you can do 6 pull ups without assistance start adding weight.
* Add weight every time you can do 6 pull ups. Rinse and repeat.

You can apply this to anything you are learning. 
Make it very easy and gradually increase the difficulty. 
_The goal is to make consistent progress everyday._
