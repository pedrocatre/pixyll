Many years ago, when I was preparing to present my master thesis my advisor gave me valuable advice I'll never forget.

Here is how that went:


<blockquote class="blockquote-smaller">
<div class="dialogue-left">
<i class="fa fa-quote-left" aria-hidden="true"></i> Remove as much information as you can.
</div>
<br><br>

<div class="dialogue-right">
<i class="fa fa-angle-right fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i>  Me: Gantt charts are boring and useless but they are expected in the presentation.
</div>
<br><br>

<div class="dialogue-left">
<i class="fa fa-quote-left" aria-hidden="true"></i>
Forget the Gantt chart and remove the technical details.
</div>
<br><br>

<div class="dialogue-right">
<i class="fa fa-angle-right fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i>   Me: They won't know how hard I worked. They won't understand the complexity of the project.
</div>
<br><br>

<div class="dialogue-left">
<i class="fa fa-quote-left" aria-hidden="true"></i> The jury knows you already... They were all your teachers in the past. 
<br><br>They know you are hard working and they expect you to give a very confusing presentation. 
<br><br>They expect you to try to cram as much information as possible during the 20 min and to speak very fast.
<br><br>Surprise them by doing the exact opposite! 
<br><br>Keep some slides hidden at the end for questions that they might ask.
Even have the damn Gantt chart if you like. 
If they ask you about it say: "I'm glad you asked" and jump to the slide and use the Q&A time to talk about this, instead of sacrificing the very limited presentation time with it.
</div>
</blockquote>


Suffice it to say I followed the advice and the presentation was a hit. 
They LOVED how simple it was.
They LOVED that the demo showed the power and potential of what I built instead of just hearing about it.
They LOVED the surprise of expecting to be confused and bored to tears but instead getting a light presentation.

The lesson is:
_Keep it simple and high level. Favour less information over too much._

P.S. no one asked me for the damn Gantt chart.
